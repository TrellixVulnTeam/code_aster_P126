   Example:

   def function(arg1, arg2):
       """What does the function.

       May add more detailed informations. Add a new line to start a
       new paragraph. Do not write lines longer than 80 chars following the
       `PEP8 <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/>`_ recommendation.

       Example of a reference to internal objects
       :py:class:`code_aster.Objects.mesh.Mesh` with it full name or
       :py:class:`~code_aster.Objects.mesh.Mesh` with its *basename*.

       Arguments:
           arg1 (int): A description of the argument. If needed, it may be
               written on several lines that must be indented before next
               argument.
           arg2 (list[str]): List of strings for the second argument.

       Returns:
           dict: This function returns a *dict* object.
           There is always only one result, eventually it's a tuple. That's
           why the continued lines are not indented here.
