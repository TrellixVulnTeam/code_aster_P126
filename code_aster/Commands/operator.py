:py:mod:`operator` --- Generic operators
****************************************

The function :py:func:`define_operators` automatically creates executors objects
(:py:class:`~code_aster.Commands.ExecuteCommand.ExecuteCommand` or
:py:class:`~code_aster.Commands.ExecuteCommand.ExecuteMacro`) for operators that
are not already defined in the store.

It is mainly a transtional feature that should make work most of the *legacy*
command with few changes.
